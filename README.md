  remove else


In this task, everything is already written for us. We only need to refactor the code! Your task is to:

Remove the declared variable let result. You're not allowed to replace it by declaring new ones.
Get rid of the keyword else and replace it with return, making sure that the logic of the function is not affected.
Do not use the ternary operator.
Try to implement these changes without breaking the code!  */
